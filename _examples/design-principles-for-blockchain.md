principles:
- principle: Human-Centered Design
  summary: |
    The most significant thing about blockchain is that people have to trust it. To attain this trust, blockchain must be designed so that everyone understands it. So, one of the most important components of blockchain design is how easily accessible it will be for humans.
- principle: Designing for Trust
  summary: |
    Designing for the blockchain means designing with the intention of building an application or a service that can be trusted, immutable, and (almost) fully transparent to all users and stakeholders.
- principle: Simplicity at the Core
  summary: |
    Make your application as simple and easy to use as possible. Blockchain creates an almost endless stream of data and information, so keeping your interface simple will make it easier for people.
