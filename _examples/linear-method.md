principles:
- principle: Build for the creators
  summary: |
    Software project management tools should build with the end users – the creators – in mind. Keeping individuals productive is more important than generating perfect reports.
- principle: Opinionated software
  summary: |
    Productivity software should be opinionated. It's the only way the product can truly do the heavy lifting for you. Flexible software lets everyone invent their own workflows, which eventually creates chaos as teams scale.
- principle: Create momentum – don't sprint
  summary: |
    We should find a cadence and routine of working. In cycles, we decide priorities and assign responsibilities. Our goal is to maintain a healthy momentum with our teams, not rush towards the end.
- principle: Meaningful direction
  summary: |
    Our daily work might be filled with tasks but we should understand and remind our teams of the purpose and long term goals of our work. Roadmaps, projects and milestones are all important to keep in mind as we plan our weekly schedules.
- principle: Aim for clarity
  summary: |
    Don’t invent terms if possible, as these can confuse and have different meanings in different teams. Projects should be called projects.
- principle: Say no to busy work
  summary: |
    Our tools should not make us the designers and maintainers of them. We should throw away or automate the busy work so you can focus on the more important work.
- principle: Simple first, then powerful
  summary: |
    Teams at different sizes have different needs. Tools should be simple to get started with and grow more powerful over time.
- principle: Decide and move on
  summary: |
    There isn't always a best answer. The important thing is to make a decision, and move on.
