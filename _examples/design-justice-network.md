principles:
- principle: We use design to **sustain, heal, and empower** our communities, as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems.

- principle:We **center the voices of those who are directly impacted** by the outcomes of the design process.

- principle: We **prioritize designâ€™s impact on the community** over the intentions of the designer.

- principle:We view **change as emergent from an accountable, accessible, and collaborative process**, rather than as a point at the end of a process.

- principle: We see the role of the **designer as a facilitator rather than an expert**.

- principle: We believe that **everyone is an expert based on their own lived experience**, and that we all have unique and brilliant contributions to bring to a design process.

- principle: We **share design knowledge and tools** with our communities.

- principle: We work towards **sustainable, community-led and -controlled** outcomes.

- principle: We work towards **non-exploitative solutions** that reconnect us to the earth and to each other.

- principle: Before seeking new design solutions, we **look for what is already working** at the community level. We honor and uplift traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge and practices.
