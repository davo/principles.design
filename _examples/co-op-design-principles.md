title: Principles
author: Co-op
overview: |
    Our digital design principles reflect how we think about design. They provide a way for us to look at the work we create and how we create it: building the right thing; building the thing right.

principles:
- principle: We design in context
  summary: |
    Communicating with a clear voice, at the right time, in the right way.

    We do this by:

    - understanding user needs, the market, technology and our business goals
    - looking at the whole experience for the user, not just the digital part
    - giving information only at the point it’s needed, and through the most effective channel
    
  
- principle: We design with purpose
  summary: |
    Making services that are useful, elegant and easy to use.

    We’re doing this by:

    - knowing why the service is needed before we build it
    - measuring and challenging the effectiveness of what we build
    - getting out of the way — helping users achieve their goals as quickly as they can
    - designing services that speak for themselves — they’re self-explanatory and intuitive
  
- principle: We design for everyone
  summary: |
    Designing so that no one feels different.

    We do this by:

    - communicating in a clear, simple way; opening up our services to everyone
    - designing for people irrespective of their background, circumstance, digital skills or subject knowledge — removing any barriers to our services
    - recognising that people come to our services with their own needs, insecurities and struggles — they deserve our consideration and thoughtfulness
  
- principle: We design with honesty
  summary: |
    Nothing made up.

    We do this by:

    - being truthful about what we can and cannot do for our users
    - talking about what we’ve done, not what we’ve yet to do
    - being true to our medium, understanding its opportunities and limits
  
- principle: We design in the open
  summary: |
    Being co-operative in the way we work with others.

    We do this by:

    - talking about what we’re making as we make it
    - being generous with what we know, and open to learning from others
    - not being afraid to experiment
  
- principle: We design iteratively
  summary: |
    There’s no substitute for putting our work in front of real people.

    We do this by:

    - releasing earlier, learning faster
    - learning from what people do, not what they say they do
    - making design decisions based on evidence
    - responding to change
